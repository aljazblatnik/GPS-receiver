# GPS-receiver (work in progress)
Multi-channel GPS receiver for L1 carrier with dedicated high-frequency frontend, processing within DSP routines and user interface on a personal computer.

## Development tools (start here)
To begin designing our own GPS receiver, we must first create proper tools for designing microcontrollers, FPGA circuits, and programmers. We need to build the following:
- One [FPGA programmer]("/development tools/FPGA/FPGA programmer")
- One [FPGA development board]("/development tools/FPGA/FPGA demo board")
- One [MCU development board]("/development tools/MCU")
